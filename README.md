# Tic-Tac-Toe Interactive Game Using Minimax Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm. The game is played GUI built using the pygame library. The Minimax algorithm is used to determine the best possible move for the computer player.

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is used for finding the best move for a player, assuming that the opponent (the human user) also plays optimally. The algorithm is used in two-player games, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, to determine the best possible move for the computer player.
